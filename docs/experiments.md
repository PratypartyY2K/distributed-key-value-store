# Experiments
- Sustainable throughput discovery: sweep clients → pick knee (<5% gain or p95 knee)
- Report p50/p95 for GET/PUT at sustainable point
- Mixes: 90/10 and 10/90; N ∈ {1,3,5}; protocols: ABD vs Blocking
- Client crash test (N=3): kill one client mid-run; show time-series throughput & latency
